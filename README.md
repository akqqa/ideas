# ideas
A bank of ideas for projects I want to make at some point

1. A python program to split my spotify liked songs into seasonal playlists to allow for playback of specific eras of my life (can expand into webapp with python backend, more features using the spotify api)
2. A simple music programming language similar to TidalCycles but very basic. Allow for defining a global tempo, instruments with chords/loops/waveforms. Can integrate with my waveform drawer. Maybe even add a piano roll. Basic DAW in fact in code form.
3. Juggling game in unity
